Features
Note List: The app displays a list of notes on the screen, where each note consists of a title and corresponding text content.

Add and Edit Notes: Users can add new notes to the list and edit existing ones. When a user wants to add a new note or edit an existing note, a form appears that allows them to enter the note's title and content.

Viewing Selected Note: When a user clicks on a note in the list, the full content of the selected note is displayed in a modal window or dedicated section. Users can view both the title and detailed content of the selected note.

Delete Note: Users have the option to delete a note from the list. By clicking on the trash icon, the respective note will be removed from the list.

Pinning and Unpinning Notes: The app provides "pin/unpin" functionality for notes. By clicking on the pin icon (Pin) next to each note, users can mark a note as "pinned" or "unpinned". Pinned notes are placed at the top of the list in the order they were pinned.

Data Persistence: Note data is stored in localStorage, which means that it will be retained even after closing and reopening the application. There is also a check to clear localStorage if there are no more notes.
